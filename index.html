                to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past.
                Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help
                both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses
                the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of
                their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box
                and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less
                complicated for staff and students alike, Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

            <img src="canteen.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12"> Implemented Online
            Attendance Management System: This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the school,
            instantly. Once a student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text
            messages. This helps schools keep a record of the students' absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by
            logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the Admin. The tracker has so
            much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish
            connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculum's subjects. As soon as you enter a student's
            Enrollment Number or Name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be
            displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the
            security offered can be so robust and powerful that those students who always fool their deans are caught in
            a shorter span just after the admin enters login details into this tracker. All this will improve accuracy
            and transparency in any of the educational institutions as students and their parents are pre-informed about
            the real-time status of leave requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at reduced costs.
